### MakersBnb

Rent and offer rooms!

Chloe, Nazia, Seb and Vu are building an airbnb clone.

## MVP: User stories

```As a user, I can offer a room```  
```As a user, I can set availability of the room```
```As a user, I can name my room, give a short description, and price per night```

```As a user, I can see a list of all rooms```  
```As a user, I can see whether a room is available```
```As a user, I can book a room if it is available```  
```As a user, I get a confirmation if I book a room```
